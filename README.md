# Bevy FiveInARow

I was amazed when a open bevy's example page and see many of them worked on my iPhone Safari.
Then the thought comes into my mind is: "I must try this, by creating a playable game touchscreen game with bevy!"

## Next Step

I may find some spare time to start from scratch...
But fortunately, I'm familiar with FiveInARow game build (I have an archived C++ version on my github~).

I'll mostly follow [bevy-tetries](https://github.com/corbamico/bevy-tetris) to get started, because I know few about bevy.
